# Water is not forever
Have you wondered why natural disasters have been occurring more frequently in recent years?

### Droughts

Droughts have multiple interconnected causes including climate change, population growth, water overexploitation and deforestation. Climate change alters precipitation patterns and makes rainfall unpredictable. Increased population leads to greater consumption, while deforestation decreases the ability of ecosystems to retain water and regulate the hydrological cycle. One of the most worrying factors is the reduction and variation in precipitation. According to data from Conagua, in June 2023 at the national level it rained 61% less compared to the average for the same month from 1991 to 2020. This impacted the country's main dams, which today - in the middle of the rainy season - They are on average at 44.6% of their capacity.

### Floods

Floods are temporary overflows of water onto land that is normally dry.

### Tropical storms and cyclones

A tropical cyclone is a rotating system, organized by clouds and storms, that originates over tropical or subtropical waters and has a closed center of circulation in the lower levels of the atmosphere. Tropical cyclones rotate counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere.

## Freshwater Cycle
Humanity has made significant technological advancements in recent decades. However, this development has not gone hand in hand with nature, and we need to understand how our actions can have a serious impact on our environment. For instance, some of the actions that occur daily in the world disrupt the natural water cycle:


### Water Pollution

Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies, such as rivers, lakes, and oceans, by harmful substances or pollutants, which can have detrimental effects on aquatic ecosystems and human health. It is a matter of concern because it not only threatens the delicate balance of aquatic life and ecosystems but also jeopardizes our access to safe and clean drinking water, which is essential for our well-being and survival.

### Oil Spill

The Gulf of Mexico is the primary region most affected by these spills, experiencing the greatest impact and consequences as a result of these incidents

### Excessive water usage

Industry and agriculture are the main sectors that consume the most water.

### Deforestation

Deforestation represents an imbalance in the planet's freshwater cycle.

### Urbanization

### Changes in land use

It is essential to remember that our universe is an interconnected system where every action has consequences. We live in a world of cause and effect, where our decisions and actions directly impact the balance of nature and the quality of life for future generations.
